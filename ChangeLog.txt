= J2EE Cache Filter =
=====================

== 2.0 ==
 * Added NoEtagFilter to disable ETag HTTP header set by the DefaultServlet in Tomcat.
 * Replaced privacy<String> parameter by private<Boolean>. Cache directive to control where the response may be cached.
 * Added static<Boolean> parameter. Conditional requests are not required for static components.
   Cache directive must-revalidate is used for non static to force that once a response becomes stale it has to be revalidated.

== 1.2.1 ==
 * Optimized the configuration process. All the configurations are now done in the init method.
 * Added the Sonatype OSS Parent POM.

== 1.2 ==
 * Changed the default package to com.samaxes.filter.
 * Updated the distribution repositories to Sonatype Nexus.

== 1.1.0 ==
 * Use response.setDateHeader() instead of response.setHeader() to set "Expires" HTTP cache header.
 * Compiled against JDK 1.5 instead of JDK 1.6.
